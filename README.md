## Ticketing System 
### Challenges
1. Recurring obsolete alerts: alerts continues to be triggered for issues no longer relevant.
2. Lack of Prioritization: No clear priority for incoming issues, hence delay and ineffectiveness is solving them.

### Proposed Solutions 
Here are some proposed tools to employ to solve the current challenges:

1. Ansible: Helps automate repeatitive tasks such as closing out alerts or prioritizing tickets based on predefined criteria.
2. Datadog: Helps to setup clear monitoring and alerts rules to avoid recuring alerts and also automate the alert workflows.
3. PagerDuty: It is a centralized alert management tool that can be used to priotize and triage alerts. Alert policies can be setup, response teams can be setup, alert history can be tracked and reports can be generated using a central management system.

Note: Ansible, Datadog and PagerDuty are some of the tools that can be employed to solve the issues with the Ticketing System, but the SRE team due to their familiarity with this tools can always use a different one and still achieve the same goal.
